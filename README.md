## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Firstp1ck/Firstp1ck** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Pacsea, an Arch TUI Package Manager
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Ratatui and the crossterm Framwork for TUI creation
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Pacsea. Any Contributions are welcome, as I want to add language support, I am still searching a Reviewer for Hungarian Language.
- 💬 Ask me about
Linux systems, Rust programming, open-source development, package management, or desktop customization with Hyprland and Arch Linux.

- 📫 How to reach me: firstpick1992@proton.me
